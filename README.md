# PersonalWebsite

## Introduction

Hello, my name is Sean Twomey and welcome to my personal website. I am a twenty-five year-old software engineer currently living in Baltimore, Maryland. This will be a place where I showcase a few of my interests such as my professional experience, photography, personal projects, and more.

## Website Organization

[www.seanpatricktwomey.com](https://www.seanpatricktwomey.com) is divided up into the following five high-level webpages, some of which have additional sub-pages. All five high-level webpages are represented as hyperlinks on the navigation bar, which is present on every webpage.  My name is also located in the top-right corner of each webpage.

### Home

This is the page shown to the user when they navigate to the website. It contains a brief welcome with an animation, the *Work Experience* tile, and the *Photography* tile. These tiles (and other tiles used throughout the website) are images which when hovered over with the mouse, will darken revealing a hyperlink. These hyperlinks link to the same webpages as their navigation bar counterparts.

### Work Experience

This page represents my professional experience, separated by company. Each company tile links to a webpage which details information such as:

- Title
- Start and end date of employment
- Brief summary of role
- List of notable involvements and contributions
- Buttons linking to company's Instagram and LinkedIn pages

### Photography

This page is split up into three tiles of *Portraits*, *Nature*, and *Close Up*. The *Portraits* tile links to a page which is split up into additional tiles organized by client name, the *Nature* tile by location, and the *Close Up* tile also by location.

### About

This page provides a brief overview of myself, a headshot, and links to my various social media and professional accounts:

### Contact
