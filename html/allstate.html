        <h2>Project Manager Intern: May 2020-August 2020</h2>
        <p>
          My first internship occured during the summer between my junior and
          senior year of college, where I was fortunate enough to work as a
          Project Manager Intern at Allstate. Originally, I was designated to
          report to the Charlotte office for this position, but due to COVID-19
          the internship was conducted virtually. During my 12 weeks with the company I was able
          to learn new skills including but not limited to project management methodologies, reporting and presentational skills,
          and Project Management Office (PMO) workflow. Despite being virtual, this internship was a very beneficial experience and an excellent first professional internship!
